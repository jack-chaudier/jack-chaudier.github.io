### Philosophy
[cite_start]I build high-performance systems, kernels, and production-grade data infrastructure[cite: 9]. I am interested in software that works under pressure—where latency, correctness, and resilience are non-negotiable design requirements.

Currently seeking **Systems SWE** & **Forward-Deployed SWE** roles for 2026.

### Selected Engineering
